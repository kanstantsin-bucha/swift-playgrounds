## Test the app

0 from a command line
1 navigate to graphql-apollo-api-part1 direcory
2 run `npm start` 

the graphql server will be started

3 run the iOS Client app


## Generate files form GraphQL Schema

run in command line from the project root directory
```
 ./apollo-ios-cli generate --verbose
```
! Be sure that in apollo-codegen-config.json 
    ```
    "schemaSearchPaths" : [
        "./GraphQLFiles/schema/*.graphql"
    ],
    ```
        and 
    ```
    "operationSearchPaths" : [
        "./GraphQLFiles/operations/*.graphql"
    ]
    ```
do not resolve to the same file twice,
otherwise it will lead to unpredictable errors during generation

It will create GraphiOSAutogenerated Swift Package
That package is included as a dependency into GraphClientPackage
No additional work is required

if there will be error that `apollo-ios-cli` not found,
1 go to https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-ios/releases
2 navigate to assets of the latest release
3 download apollo-ios-cli.tar.gz file and extract it 
near the apollo-codegen-config.json

# Alternatives

### SwiftGraphQL 

it is looking good, but library is not maintained.
2 weeks - still no answer to issue raised at github repo.

I got code generation issue. It looks like server provides schema with invalid characters inside.
And if in case GraphQL I can use a local schema that I can correct, 
in case of SwiftGraphQL there is only online way - 
the cli tool generates code using a connection to the server.
